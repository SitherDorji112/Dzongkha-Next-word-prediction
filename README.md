# Project Overview

Dzongkha Next Word Prediction Using Deep Learning is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project aimed at predicting the next Dzongkha syllable based on a given sequence of preceding syllables. The system is designed to support Dzongkha language computing and contribute to research on low-resource languages by modeling linguistic patterns from curated Dzongkha text data.
